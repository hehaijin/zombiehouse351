# ZombieHouse
3D "Zombie House" game for CS351 @ UNM

Use WASD for movement, mouse for view swivel

F1 enables full-screen mode, F2 disables it

Press Escape to exit the game

Each new level increases the player's speed and stamina, but also increases the size of the map, zombie spawn rate, and zombie speed.

A* is not working in this release, so zombies use a simple, non-collision-based directional movement.

Zombies animated in blender. Zombie model from http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/4807, texturing and animation done by us.

Program startup and level restarting/loading takes a while, due to the expensive mesh loading.
